Scrolling the mouse wheel while over the hammer should simulate the hammer being moved closer or further away, effectively scaling the hammer up or down in size. 3. Moving the mouse while holding the right mouse button down should rotate the hammer around its center, allowing users to view it from different angles. 4. Pressing and holding the 'H' key should make the hammer 'hit' by performing a quick motion animation, simulating a strike.
